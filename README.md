# 🛸 UFO Sightings Analytics Dashboard 🌌

### 📊 **Interactive Tableau Dashboard for UFO Sightings Analysis**  

This project presents an **interactive UFO Sightings Dashboard**, developed using **Tableau**, to analyze over **88,000 UFO sightings** reported across the United States over the last century. The dataset, sourced from the **National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)**, provides a wealth of information on UFO encounters, including **when**, **where**, and **how** they occurred, along with descriptions of their shapes and durations.  

With the increasing interest in **extraterrestrial phenomena, government disclosures, and scientific inquiries into UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena)**, this dashboard provides a **data-driven exploration of UFO reports**, helping to uncover **patterns, correlations, and anomalies** in sighting trends.

### 🔎 **What This Dashboard Reveals:**  
🔹 **Trends Over Time:** UFO sightings surged in the late 20th century, reaching their peak in the early 2010s before slightly declining in recent years.  
🔹 **Geographical Hotspots:** Certain states—**California, Florida, and Washington—report significantly more UFO sightings** than others, while sparsely populated areas report fewer cases.  
🔹 **Commonly Reported Shapes:** The vast majority of sightings are of **"lights" or glowing orbs**, with **disks, circles, and triangles** making up a smaller but notable portion.  
🔹 **Peak Sighting Times:** The most common time for sightings is **between 8 PM and 11 PM**, with a **sharp peak around 9–10 PM**, reinforcing the theory that low-light conditions play a key role in observations.

## **📊 Trends in UFO Sightings Over Time**  

### 📈 **Quarterly Trends Bar Graph**  

![Quarterly Trends Bar Graph](images/Quarterly%20Trends.png)  

Understanding UFO sighting trends over time can help us uncover **patterns in reporting, potential cultural influences, and changes in observational behavior**. This visualization shows the **quarterly count of UFO reports from 1994 to 2014**, revealing some fascinating insights:  

- **Surge in Sightings**: Before the 1950s, UFO reports were scarce. However, from the late 20th century onwards, sightings **skyrocketed**, peaking in the early 2000s. This growth coincides with increasing public interest in extraterrestrial phenomena, fueled by media, movies, and government disclosures.  
- **📈 Peak Sightings**: The most significant spike occurred between **2000 and 2013**, with thousands of UFO reports each quarter. This trend suggests **growing public participation in reporting sightings**, possibly driven by advancements in technology, online databases, and UFO research organizations making it easier to file reports.  
- **📉 Recent Decline**: After **2014, UFO reports declined slightly**. This could be due to **reporting fatigue, improved explanations for aerial anomalies (such as drones or satellites), or changes in public interest.**  

**Takeaway**: UFO sightings have **increased dramatically since the mid-20th century**, reflecting a combination of **cultural, technological, and observational factors**.

## **🛸 UFO Shape Distribution**  

### 🔵 **Bubble Chart of UFO Shapes**  

![UFO Shape Bubble Chart](images/Signting%20Duration.png)  

The **shape of reported UFOs** is a crucial factor in understanding sightings—whether they resemble conventional aircraft, celestial objects, or something entirely unknown. This bubble chart breaks down the **most frequently reported UFO shapes**, revealing **which descriptions dominate public sightings**.  

- **Most Commonly Reported Shape**: By far, the most frequent description is **"lights" in the sky**, suggesting that many reports could be **distant objects, celestial bodies, or atmospheric phenomena mistaken for UFOs**.  
- **🛸 Classic “Flying Saucers”**: While **disks, circles, and spheres** are prominent in pop culture depictions of UFOs, they are actually **less commonly reported than lights**. The **"triangle"** shape also stands out, potentially linking some reports to experimental aircraft or military tests.  
- **🔍 Rare Shapes**: Unique sightings include **"crescents," "hexagons," and "crosses"**, which are much less frequent. This could indicate either **genuine anomalies or subjective differences in perception among witnesses.**  

**Takeaway**: The data suggests that **most UFO reports involve simple points of light**, while the stereotypical **“flying saucer” or solid craft is much less common.**

## **📍 Geographical Hotspots of Sightings**  

### 🌎 **Geospatial Map of UFO Sightings**  

![Geospatial Map of Sightings](images/Geo%20Spatial%20Map.png)   

UFO reports are **not evenly distributed** across the United States—certain regions have significantly higher concentrations of sightings. This geospatial visualization highlights the **major UFO hotspots** and potential explanations for their distribution.  

- **California is the UFO Capital**: **With over 11,000 reports,** California leads the country in UFO sightings. Possible explanations include **its large population, major aerospace hubs (such as Area 51 and Edwards Air Force Base), and an active UFO research community.**  
- **📍 Other Hotspots**: Florida, Washington, and Arizona also rank high in UFO sightings, potentially due to **coastal observations, military presence, and a history of well-documented cases.**  
- **🌵 Sparse Sightings in the Midwest**: The **central U.S. reports fewer sightings**, likely due to **lower population density rather than fewer UFOs.** With fewer people observing the sky, fewer reports are logged.  

**Takeaway**: UFO sightings tend to be **concentrated in populous and coastal areas**, possibly due to **higher observer density, cultural factors, and proximity to military or aerospace activity.**

## **⏳ When Do UFO Sightings Happen? (Time of Day)**  

### 🕰 **Hourly Trends Bar Graph**  

![Hourly Trends Bar Graph](images/Hourly%20Signting%20Duration%20.png)  

Time-of-day trends in UFO sightings reveal a **clear pattern**, showing **when people are most likely to report unexplained aerial objects**.  

- **Peak Viewing Hours**: The majority of sightings occur **between 8 PM and 11 PM**, peaking at **9–10 PM**. This aligns with **dusk-to-nighttime observation windows**, when the sky is dark and anomalies are more visible.  
- **🌞 Dips During Daylight**: Reports **drop significantly between early morning and noon**, likely because **bright daylight makes distant objects or atmospheric anomalies harder to mistake for UFOs.**  
- **🌙 Evening Observations Matter**: The trend suggests that **UFO sightings are as much about human observational behavior as they are about actual unexplained phenomena.** People are more likely to **look up at the sky after work, during outdoor activities, or before bedtime, leading to a higher number of reports.**  

**Takeaway**: The data strongly suggests that **most UFO sightings happen when it’s dark, aligning with natural human observation habits rather than extraterrestrial visitations at specific times.**
