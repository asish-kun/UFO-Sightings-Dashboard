# 🚀 UFO Sightings Analytics Dashboard 🌌

## 📊 Interactive Tableau Dashboard for UFO Sightings Analysis  

This repository showcases a **Tableau Dashboard** analyzing over **88,000 UFO sightings** reported across the United States over the past century. Using data from the **National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)**, this project visualizes patterns in **sighting trends, geographic hotspots, common UFO shapes, and time-based occurrences** to uncover fascinating insights into when, where, and how people report unidentified flying objects.  

### 📌 **Key Insights from the Dashboard**  

### 1️⃣ **📈 Trends in UFO Sightings Over Time**  
![Quarterly Trends Bar Graph](images/quarterly_trends.png)  

- **Surge in Sightings**: Reports of UFOs were rare before the 1950s but skyrocketed in the late 20th century.  
- **Peak Sightings**: The early 2000s witnessed a massive increase in UFO reports, suggesting growing public interest or increased sky monitoring.  
- **Recent Decline**: Reports slightly declined after 2014, possibly due to reporting fatigue or better explanations for aerial phenomena.

### 2️⃣ **🛸 UFO Shape Distribution**

- **Most Commonly Reported Shape**: The **"light"** category dominates UFO reports, accounting for tens of thousands of sightings.  
- **Classic "Flying Saucers"**: Circular and disk-shaped UFOs are frequent but outnumbered by light-based sightings.  
- **Rare Shapes**: Exotic shapes like "crescents," "hexagons," and "crosses" are barely reported, suggesting that most sightings fall into familiar forms.

### 3️⃣ **📍 Geographical Hotspots of Sightings**  
![UFO Sightings Map](images/geospatial_map.png)  

- **California is the UFO Capital**: With over 11,000 reports, California leads in UFO sightings, possibly due to its large population and aerospace industry.  
- **Other Hotspots**: Florida, Washington, and Arizona also show high numbers of reports, hinting at cultural, geographic, or observational factors.  
- **Sparse Sightings in the Midwest**: Less populated states report fewer UFOs, likely due to lower observer density rather than fewer UFOs themselves.

### 4️⃣ **⏳ When Do UFO Sightings Happen? (Time of Day)**  
![Hourly Trends Bar Graph](images/hourly_trends.png)  

- **Peak Viewing Hours**: Most UFO sightings occur between **8 PM and 11 PM**, with the highest activity around **9–10 PM**.  
- **Dips During Daylight**: Sightings drop significantly from early morning to noon, likely due to high visibility making lights harder to mistake for UFOs.  
- **Evening Observations Matter**: The trend suggests that darkness plays a significant role in how and when people notice aerial anomalies.
